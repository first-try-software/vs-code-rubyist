# Change Log

All notable changes to the "rubyist" extension will be documented in this file.

## [1.2.0]

- Tweaked colors with specs in mind.
- Removed most bold.
- Set bracket colors.

## [1.1.0]

- Comments are little less dim for readability in legacy codebases. But, keep writing well named abstractions with expressive tests anyway.
- Instance variables are now purple to differentiate them from other concepts so they're easier to see when looking at a file.
- Classes and methods are now dark blue rather than dark grey 'cause we think it looks better.

## [1.0.0]

- Initial release
